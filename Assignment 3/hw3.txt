Homework 3


1):
The line is redundant because in the patch, the goto
loop is removed, so there is no longer a need for this line.
It was probably removed to ensure that the removed
method was not accidentally called.

2):
First of all, for files more than a year old, the new format
(after applying the patch) does not show the time, since the
time is replaced by the year. In addition, since the patch
forces a change of the format regardless of locale, people
in non-English speaking countries will not be able to
understand the new date format since it displays english
months.

3):
When I ran the command:
$ python randline.py empty.txt
the following error output was produced:

turn seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Several exception are thrown by the script because the number
of lines in the class randlines was 0 and there are multiple
statements in the code which access lines in the first
argument. For instance, and IndexError is raised because
the seq variable is empty.
Additionally, the statement on line 64 throws an exception
because it tries to output a randomly chosen line, but there
are no lines to choose from in the argument with index 1.

4):
The script randline.py does not work with python3,
because automatic tuple unpacking was discontinued in
python3. Therefore, exceptions in Python2 are iterable,
but exceptions in Python 3 are not,so the following
exception was thrown: 

File "randline.py", line 65
  except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
