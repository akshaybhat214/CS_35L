Laboratory Section:

1.
In order to download and extract the directory I used:

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
and then
tar xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

These commands downloaded and unzipped the coreutils folder.

2.
After extraction, navigated into the coreutils7.6 directory and typed
the following command, which created makeFile for the specfied
directory, and then installed coreUtils 7.6 in the directory
of my choice:

$ ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classabh/coreutilsInstall/
$ make
$ make install

Initially, I made the mistake of using the --prefix flag for make
install, and it gave me an error. The flag is only required for
configure.

3.
In order to reproduce the bug on my machine,
I navigated to the bin folder within the coreUtils directory,
and executed the following command:

$ ./ls -l
As expected, the date was shown in the incorrect format,
since the default locale on the SEASnet server is en_US.UTF-8.

4.
I used the command $ patch -p1 < patchfile.diff to apply the
patch to ls.c. However, there was an error with one of the Hunks,
so I had to open ls.c with emacs and manually make the changes
in lines 2030 to 2037.

5.
After going to the directory coreutils-7.6 and typing the command:
$ make

The following output was then produced:

For most directories, no changes were required since they were not
affected by modifications to ls.c. However, we see that for certain files
like ls.l vdir.l and dir.l were generated because these files
had to be recompiled due to the changes in ls.c
Similarly, ls.o ls vdir and dir were all files that had to be regenerated
to compile coreutils-7.6 and apply the changes. ls.o is the object code
file which is modified by the linker, whereas ls is the actual executable
which is obviously modified in order to fix the bug.

6.
Returning the coreutils-7.6/src and typing the command:
$ ./ls -l
We can see that the changes were applied successfully.
The date is now represented in the correct format.

In order to test this with an old file, I typed the following command
in the coreutils-7.6/src directory:

$ touch â€“t 201301210959.30 test_file followed by '$ ./ls -l'.

The patch still worked on the file even though it was more than a
year old. However, it did not display the time in the third field,
instead it displayed the year.

Navigating into coreutilsInstall/bin (the folder in which I
installed coreutils-7.6), I repeated the above process
(in order to use the previously intalled version of ls),and
the command would print out the files (including the new one) in
the incorrect format.
