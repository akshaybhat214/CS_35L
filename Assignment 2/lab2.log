Laboratory Section:

-The first command outputs individual words on each line,
followed by different numbers of new lines depending on
how many non-alphabetic characters there are.
-The second command outputs the same as the first command,
but without the new lines(i.e it removes repeated characters).
-The third command sorts the results from the second command.
-The fourth command takes the results of the previous command
and eliminates repeats.
-The fifth command takes the results of the previous command and
compares them with those in the file 'words', producing columns
indicating which words exist in each file.
-The sixth and final command only ouputs words unique to the first
file.

The following is the script I wrote the extract the hawaiian words
from the website:

#! /bin/bash
cat $1 | grep td|
    tr -d '[:blank:]'| tr -d '\r'|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'|
    grep '<td>.*</td>' | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | sed 's/,/\n/g'|
    egrep '^[^bcdfgjqrstwxyz]+$' |  sed "s/\`/\'/g" | sort -u

Then I followed these steps to spellcheck:

1.
I used the script to create a dictionary of Hawaiian words as follows:
 cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords >hwords

2.
Then, we modify the given command as follows to spellcheck the
webpage in Hawaiian:
 tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html | sort -u |
 tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | comm -23 - hwords

4.
By adding >H_misspelled at the end of the previous command,
we obtain a list of words in the webpage that were 'misspelled'
in Hawaiian.

5.
The following command creates a list of words misspelled in English:
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html | sort -u |
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | comm -23 - words >E_misspelled

6.
If we ran this same command on hwords instead of assign2.html,
since every entry will be matching with the Hawaiian dictionary,
there will be no output.

7.
Now we simply have to compare the lists of misspelled words
using:
comm -23 E_misspelled H_misspelled 
and/or
comm -23 H_misspelled E_misspelled 

in order to get the number of misspelled words in either
list which did not match with the other misspelled list
we append | wc -l to the end of the previous command.

These are examples of words found in both lists:
hword
hwnwdseng
wget
gnu
