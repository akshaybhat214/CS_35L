1. man -K "str" where str is whatever string we want to search for in
the man pages.
man man shows us the manual for man, and then we can see that
-K searched through manual pages for the string.

2./usr/local/cs/bin/cp
  /usr/local/cs/bin/wc
  Found using: $ which cp and $ which wc
  
3. Some executables which are one character long are '[', 'w' and 'X'
w shows who is logged on and their processes,
and X is network-transparent windows system.
It was found by searching for executables one character long,
and selecting those which belonged to a directory ending in /bin.

4. gcc is executed
this was found using the command $readlink /usr/bin/cc
   
5.The group permissions bit cannot be altered in absolute mode
so it must be set in symbolic mode. g-s sets the bits in symbolic mode.
This was found by searching the man page of chmod.
$man chmod followed by
/g-s

6. the option is -mtime.
the full command is '$ find -mtime -3'.

7.Use the command '$find -mtime -3 -type d'.
chmod's man page tells us that we can find directories using -type d.

8. There are 18 files which are symbolic links in the same directory as find.
This was found using the following commands:
'$ which find' to find the directory holding find
after changing directory to the previously found directory,
'$ find -type l | wc -l' to get the number of files which are symbolic links.

9. the oldest regular file is libsqlite.so.0.8.6
It is found using the commmand 'ls -l -t | tail --line 1'
This lists them in order of age, and then outputs the last file.

10. /usr/bin/locale
This directory was found using 'which locale'

11. Buffer-menu-sort
    sort-columns
    sort-fields
    sort-lines
    sort-numeric-fields
    sort-pages
    sort-paragraphs
    sort-regexp-fields
    tabulated-list-col-sort
    tabulated-list-sort
These commands were found by opening Emacs and typing C-h a sort <RET>.

12.
C-a      	move-beginning-of-line
C-b 	        backward-char
C-c	       	mode-specific-command-prefix
C-d		delete-char
C-e		move-end-of-line
C-f		forward-char
C-g		keyboard-quit
C-h		help-command
C-j		electric-newline-and-maybe-indent
C-k		kill-line
C-l		recenter-top-bottom
C-n		next-line
C-o		open-line
C-p		previous-line
C-q		quoted-insert
C-r		isearch-backward
C-s		isearch-forward
C-t		transpose-chars
C-u		universal-argument
C-v		scroll-up-command
C-w		kill-region
C-x		Control-X-prefix
C-y		yank
C-z		suspend-frame

These were found by first using the command '$ emacs'.
Then entering the manual using 'C-h b'.
This will show all bindings.

13. C-g is the quit command and will kill any commands currently
running in emacs.

14.Yanking is inserting text which was previously killed.
To copy-paste text, we first kill it and then yank it.
This was found by goinng into emacs and entering the manual
using 'C-h b' and the entering the directory called "Killing".

15.The difference is that while using the emacs dired command,
you can directly modify files by placing the cursor on the file.
If we use the ls -l command,it only lists the files,
but we still need to write seperate commands for each file
we want to modify/remove.
