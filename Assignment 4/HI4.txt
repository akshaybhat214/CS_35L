2.
$git checkout v3.0 -b quote
This command created a new branch called 'quote',
after first checking out version 3.0 of Diffutils.

3.
Applied patch with:
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

As expected, only 6 .c files were modified.
No manual changes were required.

4,5.
Opened log file with:
$ emacs ChangeLog
Used emacs command 'C-x 4-a' to create log entry, filled
in the changes to 6 .c files.

6.
#add modified files to index.
$ git add .

#commit changes to quote branch using ChangeLog as commit message.
$ git commit -F ChangeLog
#check that log entry was correctly added.
$ git log

7.
Created formatted patch file using following:
$  git format-patch -1 0eec33c241616c6061c1f999fde37c558af81767

#change name of formatted patch 
$ mv  0001-2015-04-25-Akshay-Bhat-classabh-lnxsrv01.seas.ucla.e.patch
../../formatted-patch.txt

#formatted-patch.txt now contains the patch as well as the log
entry with my details amended on the top.

8.
#Create new branch and checkout original version 3.0 of Diffutils
$ git checkout master
$ git checkout -b partner v3.0

#install partners patch
$ git am ../partner-patch.txt

#check log to make sure changes were automatically committed.
$ git log

#check that patch works
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

#The above steps produced the same output as when I ran my own patch.

9.
After runing the command:
$ make distdir

#I inspected the ChangeLog file in the newly created diffutils-3.0.1-a3be
#directory and found that all the commits, were added, including the
#latest one by my partner.
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-a3be
$emacs ChangeLog

10.
#Connected to the SEASnet remote server and opened lnxsrv. 
 $cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
 $gitk

#the gitk window opens up and I scroll to the corresponding merge on
2015-1-23 by Stefan Monnier.
