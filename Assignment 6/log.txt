1. INITIAL SETUP
The following commands, grabbed the necessary
serverside and client SSH tools.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

2.
CLIENT-SIDE

The following commands were used to connect to a server
hosted by Anirudha Ajay:

//This creates a private and public SSH keys in the
// .ssh directory in my home directory.
$ ssh-keygen

//Check if the server responds, and it is possible to
//The server did, in fact, connect and the terminal printed
//multiple lines with round-trip time to send a message.
$ ping 10.97.85.249

//The following command copies my public key to the server
//hosted at 10.97.85.249
$ ssh-copy-id -i anirudh@10.97.85.249

//Initially, tried the command 'eval ssh-agent', but had to
//include the -s flag with backticks. The command creates
//an authetication agent that prevents us from having to enter
//the pasphrase every time we access a private key through SSH.
$ eval `ssh-agent -s`

//The following command registers the private key with the agent.
//We never need to enter the passphrase after this. SSH will just
//verify with the agent.
$ ssh-add

//Finally, this command allows us to remotely access the user
//on the remote machine with the specified ip address. The
// -X flag ensures that X11 forwarding is enabled.
$ ssh -X anirudh@10.97.85.249

After completing the above process, I typed ifconfig to make
sure that the IP adress was the same as the host server's.
(10.97.85.249)

3. SERVER-SIDE

//Created a new user akshay. The 'sudo' term is used because
// the default user is actually ubuntu on this temporary boot.
$ sudo useradd -d /home/akshay -m akshay

//Created a password for the recently-created user.
$ sudo passwd akshay

//Moved to the home directory of the new user.
$ cd /home/akshay

//Creates a directory .ssh in which we store the IDs
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

//Changes the ownership of the .ssh folder, so that clients can access it
$ sudo chown -R akshay .ssh

//Ensures that the directory is writable, so that clients can
//use ssh-add, and access the folder.
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh 

// This gave me the IP address of the server. This is what I gave to Panos
//and Anirudh, so that they could connect to my server.
$ ifconfig

//The following command listed all the  processes, and showed that ssh-agent was
//running, as well as the PID of the ssh-agent:
$ ps aux | grep ssh
