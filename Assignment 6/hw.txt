Homework 6 (CS 35L Lab 5)

1.
The network would still be secure because the bytes are
encrypted, and hence useless without the private key.

a)
If other teams had access to my keystrokes, the data would
not be secure because they would know the usernames and
passwords necessary to obtain the private key and decode
the messages.
However, this could be prevented by using an ssh-agent,
which SSH directly communicates with in order to check for
the passwords. This way, even by monitoring the keystrokes,
it would not be possible to obtain the password for the
private key.

b)
If we were booting off a USB drive, it would be significantly
easier for the other teams to access the decrypted data,
since they would now have access to the private key, and
could easily decrypt any messages being sent to me.

2.
The gpg --verify command only verfies that the same public
key was used to sign the document, so it is
possible for someone to sign a document as another person.
The command can verify that the document was not tampered with,
but it has no way of ensuring that the person who signed the
document in the first place is actually who they say they are.

The solution to this problem is to rely on companies like
VeriSign, which we trust to verify the identity of the sender,
by comparing the public key of the sender against their comprehensive
database of public-key holders. This way, we can ensure that someone
who sent a message is actually a holder of that particular public key.
